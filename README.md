# leaflet-map-example
A simple leaflet map example from my blog at https://opengislab.com/

The actual blog post that accompanies this is here: https://opengislab.com/blog/2018/2/4/creating-simple-leaflet-web-map

Demo site: https://stephsaephan.github.io/leaflet-map-example/

For the demo web map all of the data layers are turned off by default with exception of a basemap. I also included OSM 2.5D builidngs to the map as well. You may have to zoom in/out at different scales to see some of the map layers. For example, the 2.5D buildings will only display when shown at scale of about 1000ft - if you zoom out before 1000ft it will not display.
